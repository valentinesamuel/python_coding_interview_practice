def find_product(lst):
    """
    PROBLEM: Implement a function, find_product(lst), which modifies a list so that each index has a product of all the numbers present in the list except the number stored at that index.

    Input: A list of numbers (could be floating points or integers)

    Output: A list such that each index has a product of all the numbers in the list except the number stored at that index.

    Example Input: 
    arr1 = [1,2,3,4]
    arr2 = [2, 5, 9, 3, 6]
    arr3 = [0, 1, 10, 100]
    arr4 = [0, 2, 9, 0, 12, 25]

    Example Output:
    arr1 = [24,12,8,6]
    arr2 = [810, 324, 180, 540, 270]
    arr3 = [1000, 0, 0, 0]
    arr4 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    APPROACH:
    - Initial thoughts: Find the product of the whole array and at each index, divide the total product by the index value. But some platforms do not allow this.

    - Plan: 
        - Iterate through the array
        - Create a new array that would hold the product of all values to the left of the indexed value.
        - Since there is no element before the fist element, initialize the left variable to 1 and append it to the array and move to the next index
            - Then we update the left variable to be the product of the left variable and the number at the current index. Else, we will have 1s through out the array.
        - Then we start at the last index of the input array and multiply the left product value and the right product.
            - Then we update the right product value to hold the product of the right value and the value at the current index from the inout array
