def merge_lists(lst1, lst2):

    PROBLEM: Implement a function that merges two sorted lists of m and n elements respectively, into another sorted list. 

    Input: Two sorted lists.

    Output: A merged and sorted list consisting of all elements of both input lists.

    Example Input: 
    list1 = [1,3,4,5]  
    list2 = [2,6,7,8]

    Example Output:
    arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

    APPROACH:
    - Initial thoughts: This problem can be solved using the merge part of the merge-sort algorithm.
    
    - Plan: 
        - Use two pointers, one at the beginning of each lists. Iterate through the array while the indices of each list is smallet than the length of the list.
        - At every iteration, check which one is bigger and smaller.
        - Put the smaller in the new list and move the pointer for that list foward. 
        - If any item is remaining in the list, just add it to the new list
        - Return the new list
