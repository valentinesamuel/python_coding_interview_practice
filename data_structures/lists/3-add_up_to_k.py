def find_sum(lst, k):
    """
    PROBLEM: Given a list and a number "k", find two numbers from the list that sum to "k".

    Input: A list and a number k

    Output: A list with two integers a and b that add up to k

    Example Input: 
    lst = [1,21,3,14,5,60,7,6]
    k = 81

    Example Output:
    lst = [21,60]

    APPROACH:
    - Initial thoughts: This problem can be solved using a python dictionary.

    - Plan: 
        - Iterate through the array
        - On every iteration, check if the number exists in the python dictionary.
        - If it does, return the number from the dictionary and its payload.
        - If it does not, store number as the key as the key and the remainder(target_total - number) in the dictionary. i.e { list_number : remainder }
        - Because it is easier to check if the remainant exists in the dictionary than to check for the actual number. i.e we only check if the remainant has appeared in the list by using the list_number as key.
