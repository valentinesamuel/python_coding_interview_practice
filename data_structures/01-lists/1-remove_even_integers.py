def remove_even(lst: list) -> list:
    """
    PROBLEM: Implement a function that removes all the even elements from a given list.

    Input: A list with random integers.

    Output: A list with only odd integers

    Example Input: 
    my_list = [1,2,4,5,10,6,3]  

    Example Output:
    my_list = [1,5,3]

    APPROACH:
    - Initial thoughts: This problem can be solved using the modulo operator, which is an efficient way to find out if there is a remainder after dividing a number.
    
    - Plan: 
        - Iterate through the array, check the remainder of the current number using number % 2. 
        - If the remainder is not 0, then that number is an odd number because 2 is an even number and it can divide any even number without remainder
