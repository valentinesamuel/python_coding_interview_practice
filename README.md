# Preparing For My Python Coding Interview On Educative.io

### I know that the method of testing used in this repo is not ideal.. But i chose this method because i just want to move fast.

I also accompany these solutions with a notion database [here](https://valentinesamuel.notion.site/1acf3e07c3bd4a14bc0a8a2b861308ed?v=48cb6248686540b994a7aa47908a3f21&pvs=4).

I also found some practice questions at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ng4JxS9Z_O0X4vwVb_w8YI-nUkXmaA5o20tSKIvkjac/edit?usp=sharing

it contains various categories of questions.
